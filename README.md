# Differential Expression Gene Analysis & Pathway Enrichment Analysis

In this project we will be using an RNA-sequencing dataset from the MAGNet consortium found here https://github.com/mpmorley/MAGNet. 

This dataset is a spectacular resource of left ventricular transcriptomes of
non-failing healthy donors, Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM), Hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (HCM) and Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients. Next to the RNA-
sequencing data (in log2-transformed CPM values), extensive participant information is
available (age, sex, ethnicity, disease state, and so on). 

The goal of this project was to create a workflow capable of differential gene expression analysis and pathway enrichment analysis on DCM patients. 

#Usage 
Note: This code can be used for differential gene expression analysis and pathway enrichment analysis of any disease as long as your data has a similar format as the data used here! 

#Future 
More features will added to the project such as; 

-Adjusting unkown data-formats --> If needed , the program will adjust your data in the accepted format for further analysis. If your data is missing essential components, the program will warn you abou this as well. 

-Machine learning capabilities --> The program will be able to predict wheter a patient ahs DCM, HCM , PPCM or is Healthy based on gene expression data an patient characteristics
